Let's talk Typescript and friends. A new meetup focused on the world of types in
JS, and much more.

Our first meetup will happen soon! (Date TBD) We have slots available for
speakers, if you're interested in speaking please
[shoot us an email](mailto:me@dylanpyle.com).  We love first time talks!

Typed Web expects all speakers and attendees to follow the
[JSConf code of conduct](https://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html).
